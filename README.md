The Resources folder contains the crypto_market_data.csv file we will be analizing.

Crypto_Clustering.ipynb contains the python code for processing the crypto data.


## Installing
This was generated using jupyter lab and visual studio on a Windows 10 Pro system.


## Usage
Run Crypto_Clustering.ipynb in jupyter lab.

## Contributing
Thank you to CG:AF at Central Grading for refering me to https://community.codenewbie.org/kwing25/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-project-16ej. I have used this as a template instead of the template from the Gitlab repository for class. Hopefully y'all like it better.

https://holoviz.org/tutorial/Composing_Plots.html for creating composite plots.

The lecture materials were my biggest guide.
